            <p id="End">Note to the user: This is more than a game; in fact, it's meant to teach you, dear student, that you can make your dreams come true, regardless of 
            income, racial background, lack of opportunities available to you. There are, of course, obstacles; however, you have learned that it 
            is possible to avoid them through your hunger of success. Welcome to the future of education!
